BATTING TIPS
EYES UP!
Watch the ball. This is perhaps the most important tip for a batter. Always keep your eye on the ball, right up to the time it strikes the bat.

STEADY AHEAD
Try to keep your head as still as possible when the bowler is approaching and when delivering the ball. Be relaxed, balanced and comfortable in your stance, with your feet apart and the bat upright behind you, ready to hit the ball.

THE RIGHT CALL
When you’re about to run between wickets, you should call using only three words. ‘Yes’, ‘No’ or ‘Wait’. If the ball is hit in front of the wicket, the batter on strike should call. If the ball goes behind the wicket, the batter at the other end (the non-striker) should make the call.

GET TO THE PITCH
When playing a front foot shot (defence or attack), try to get your foot (left foot for right-hand batters and right foot for left-hand batters) as close as possible to where the ball hits the pitch. Play these shots with your bat as close to your front pad as possible.

ON THE BACK FOOT
Step back and across to give yourself time with back foot shots. When sweeping, pulling and hooking, try to roll your wrists to close the face of the bat as you hit the ball. This way, the ball will travel along the ground and you won’t get caught out. If you’re going fora six, don’t roll your wrists.

STRAIGHT BAT
Make sure you take the bat back straight behind you before your shot. This way, you’ll follow through correctly and present the full face of the bat when striking the ball. The shot should go where you intend it to go!

ELBOW UP!
When hitting the ball, the elbow of your left arm (right arm for lefthanders) should be nice and high. This will help you to avoid hitting the ball into the air and popping small catches to the bowler and close in fielders. If you’re not quite to the pitch of the ball, offer a dead bat. Let the ball come onto the bat rather than following through with the shot.

FAST ON YOUR FEET
Good, fast footwork is so important. You’ll probably be playing either a shot off your front foot or a shot off your back foot. Be quick and sure with your footwork at all times.

I’M STUCK!
Don’t get stuck while you’re batting. Always look for a quick single to put the pressure back on the fielding team. Batting is all about scoring runs and protecting your wicket. Look around the field and be aware of gaps and empty spaces where you might be able to score runs.

IT’S OKAY!
Scoring runs is so much fun, but sometimes it just doesn’t work out. Often you can play three, four or more games without scoring runs. Stay positive. Believe in yourself. Even the best batters in the world make ducks. Practise at home, in the nets, with friends, in the back garden, and remember that you’ll be in the runs again soon.
