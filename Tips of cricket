BATTING TIPS
EYES UP!
Watch the ball. This is perhaps the most important tip for a batter. Always keep your eye on the ball, right up to the time it strikes the bat.

STEADY AHEAD
Try to keep your head as still as possible when the bowler is approaching and when delivering the ball. Be relaxed, balanced and comfortable in your stance, with your feet apart and the bat upright behind you, ready to hit the ball.

THE RIGHT CALL
When you’re about to run between wickets, you should call using only three words. ‘Yes’, ‘No’ or ‘Wait’. If the ball is hit in front of the wicket, the batter on strike should call. If the ball goes behind the wicket, the batter at the other end (the non-striker) should make the call.

GET TO THE PITCH
When playing a front foot shot (defence or attack), try to get your foot (left foot for right-hand batters and right foot for left-hand batters) as close as possible to where the ball hits the pitch. Play these shots with your bat as close to your front pad as possible.

ON THE BACK FOOT
Step back and across to give yourself time with back foot shots. When sweeping, pulling and hooking, try to roll your wrists to close the face of the bat as you hit the ball. This way, the ball will travel along the ground and you won’t get caught out. If you’re going fora six, don’t roll your wrists.

STRAIGHT BAT
Make sure you take the bat back straight behind you before your shot. This way, you’ll follow through correctly and present the full face of the bat when striking the ball. The shot should go where you intend it to go!

ELBOW UP!
When hitting the ball, the elbow of your left arm (right arm for lefthanders) should be nice and high. This will help you to avoid hitting the ball into the air and popping small catches to the bowler and close in fielders. If you’re not quite to the pitch of the ball, offer a dead bat. Let the ball come onto the bat rather than following through with the shot.

FAST ON YOUR FEET
Good, fast footwork is so important. You’ll probably be playing either a shot off your front foot or a shot off your back foot. Be quick and sure with your footwork at all times.

I’M STUCK!
Don’t get stuck while you’re batting. Always look for a quick single to put the pressure back on the fielding team. Batting is all about scoring runs and protecting your wicket. Look around the field and be aware of gaps and empty spaces where you might be able to score runs.

IT’S OKAY!
Scoring runs is so much fun, but sometimes it just doesn’t work out. Often you can play three, four or more games without scoring runs. Stay positive. Believe in yourself. Even the best batters in the world make ducks. Practise at home, in the nets, with friends, in the back garden, and remember that you’ll be in the runs again soon.



BOWLING TIPS
A FAST BOWLER’S CHECKLIST
Grip
Place your first two fingers on the seam with a finger’s width between. Your thumb should be on the seam on the under side of the ball.

Run-up
This should be smooth, even and balanced as you build up pace approaching the bowling crease.

Gather
This is your delivery stride, which should remain balanced. Your non-bowling arm should be high and bent at the elbow, acting as a sighter for your target.

Back-foot landing
Jump to land on a firm, stable back leg. This should give you good drive into your bowling delivery. Make sure that your body is in the upright position.

Delivery
Try not to rotate your hips and shoulders as you move into your stride. Transfer your weight smoothly onto your front foot as you’re about to deliver the ball.

Release
Again, be strong and upright as you release the ball. Keep your bowling arm nice and high, and try to keep it as close to your body as possible.

Follow
You’ll increase your pace and gain through better control if you maintain momentum through towards the batter, have good hip rotation and a full arm action.

GO SOLO!
If you’re really serious about improving your bowling technique, organise yourself a bucket of balls, a set of stumps and fi nd a cricket net to work in. You don’t need a batter. Just focus on your technique and where you’ll pitch the ball so you are better able to control the line and length of your deliveries.

BOWLING A SWINGER!
This is for bowling to a right- hand batter. Grip the ball so that the seam is angled slightly off line, towards fi ne leg and have the shiny side of the ball on the inside. Place your first two fingers down the seam, slightly apart with your thumb on the seam beneath the ball. As you release the ball, pull down hard with your fi ngers to get maximum effect on the ball. For an out-swinger, angle the ball towards first slip and
have the shiny side of the ball to the outside. For both, keep the seam of the ball as upright as possible for maximum swing.

SLOW IT DOWN!
Try to keep your delivery consistent so that the batter doesn’t know you’re about to go for a slower delivery. As you approach, slide your first finger down and away from the seam. Now you’re bowling more of an off-cutter. The ball should come out slower as you’re bowling across the seam. This one needs lots of practice so you can maintain control. You can try dropping the other finger, which would produce a leg- cutter!

SPIN IT!
A leg-spinner turns from the leg to the offside for a right- hand batter. Grip the ball firmly with your middle three fingers. Your thumb is there for back- up support. As you deliver the ball, try to produce maximum spin with your third or fourth finger. The ‘wrong- un’ or ‘googly’ is a variation: do everything the same, but release the ball with the back of your hand facing the batter.

NO MORE NO-BALLS!
All you’ll need is a measuring tape and a friend. Find a good patch of oval (not near the pitch or nets), and put down a marker at the start of your run. Close your eyes and pretend that you’re running into bowl. Jump into your delivery stride when it feels right. Have your partner mark where your front foot lands. Repeat – the more times the better. Now measure your run- up. This is your perfect and ideal running length. You’ll need to practise heaps so that it becomes instinct. Later, you can count the strides of your run- up so you know where to mark the start of your run- ups in games.
